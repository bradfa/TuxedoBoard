The TuxedoBoard is an embedded computer open source / free hardware project.

## Project Goals:
* All hardware designs will be completely open.
* Only open source / free software will be used to create the hardware and software
used on the project.
* No closed source: no binary blob kernel modules, no non-free IP cores, no DSPs
that require closed source compilers.
* Fully functional, assembled boards will be sold.
* Target price is $100 (USD).

## Technical Requirements
* Run Linux.
* Boot from an SD card (MMC).
* Interface with existing hardware accessories, such as Arduino shields.
* Have Ethernet.
* Have USB, preferrably USB 2.0.
* Address at least 256 MB of RAM (even if shipping boards have less).
* A real serial port UART (DB9 style).
